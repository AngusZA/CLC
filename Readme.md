## For Database connection:

See `clc.sql` for database table creation then set `src/Env.php` environment variables

*Notes:*
- InnoDB is the preferred engine but MyISAM was used.
- I could've improved the classes to align more with SOLID methodology but it would be over engineering it. 
- I opted for a scalable design aligned to MVC methodology (**no frameworks used**). I probably could've saved a ton of time doing it View-first.
